## Documentation

**Used libraries**
- **Redux Tool Kit:** managing patients state data across the app
- **axios:** server requests
- **formik:** handling form state
- **react-toastify:** handling notifications
- **typescript:** specify data types in the code
- **yup:** validating html form data

**Brief explanation on design**

I used some design patterns such as:
- **Container/Presenter Pattern:** Used for componentization with the patients list, in order not to have everything in the same component, although I would have liked it to be reusable.
- **Custom Hooks:** Used some external custom hooks from redux in order to manage and use the state data.
- **Conditional Rendering:** So some of the code is not rendered when it's not needed, in order to get a better performance.
- **Render Props:** Used in little functions such as getData and getEditIcon, to separate the code in smaller pieces and make it more readable.
- **Utility Functions:** Such as formatDate, still I would have liked to move it to a Utils.ts file.
